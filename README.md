Script and notebook to plot pedestrian fatality risk using Tefft (2013) and Mueller (2025) models. 

Plots pedestrian risk vs. impact speed for:
  - Tefft (2013) death risk (U.S. crash-reconstruction logistic model)
  - Monfort & Mueller (2025) injury risk (fatal / MAIS 3+F / MAIS 2+F),
    with hood leading-edge (HLE) height, age, sex, and speed (km/h).

Don't know Python or R? Cool, use this webpage to play with the models: [https://brianalmdale.shinyapps.io/ped_fatality_risk/](https://brianalmdale.shinyapps.io/ped_fatality_risk/)
